# Computer-Vision

This article is a part of an assignment for the Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision module taken at the Atlantic Technological University. The purpose is to implement lane detection and investigate the efficiency of the various hyperparameters settings. As the test video was taken, video from Sligo, Ireland (test video).  

The whole process and explanations could be founded in Computer Vision - assign. #1.pdf

Initial code was taken from the “OpenCV Python Tutorial for Beginners 31 - Road Lane Line Detection with OpenCV”. GitHub repository [pknowledge/detector.py]. 
The finalized version of the project, as well as the videos, could be founded in a GitHub repository [GusevPortfolio/Computer-Vision].
